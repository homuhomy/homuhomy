### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nur Anati Nabilah Binti Abdul Aziz! You might ask...why Homuhomy? It's just my nickname that I have been using as my artist name since I was 15 ðŸ¤©

I'm currently a student in the Software Maintenance and Evolution course.
As I'm approaching my final semester, I hope that this course will allow me to learn how to optimize the performance of the software by improving its efficiency and speed to improve the user experience!

- **Fun fact**: I love to draw! I used to want to be an architect, then I realise I don't actually like designing buildings ðŸ™ƒ

Here is me and my cat!
